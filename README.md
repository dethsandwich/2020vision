It's hard to keep track of all the candidates that have already announced their intentions to run for President in 2020. We thought that making a simple, easy to use app that introduces each candidate would be useful in educating voters.

*2020 Vision* stores detailed information to educate current voters and students about our sitting president and nine popular Democratic candidates. App users can take a special assessment, the VisionMatch quiz, to find the candidate that most aligns with their views. Using a unique, complex algorithm, the app is able to differentiate between each of the candidates to find users their perfect match. Users can then click on links to learn more about each candidate and find out what exactly they stand for.
